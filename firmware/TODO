More control modes:
	Constant feed mode (mm/s)
	Slotting mode (mm/s with depth limit)
	Depth limit for feeding and threading

Finesse UI
	Do something with the big red button (feed hold? reverse?)
	Reverse direction in software (needs accel/decel control)

Control loop
	Detect when we can't keep up with the spindle (either servo RPM
	limit or pulse output rate)
	Implement acceleration and deceleration control
	Implement max servo RPM
