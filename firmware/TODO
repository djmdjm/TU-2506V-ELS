More control modes:
	Constant feed mode (mm/s)
	Slotting mode (mm/s with depth limit)
	Depth limit for threading

Finesse UI
	Do something with the big red button (feed hold? reverse?)
	Reverse direction in software (needs accel/decel control)

Improve TPI mode
	Can make a control.set_feed_rate_tpi() that calculates the
	multiplication factor directly from the TPI. This should avoid
	the errors in the current Âµm/rev approximation.
