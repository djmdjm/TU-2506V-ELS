If I ever redesign the electronics, here are changes to make:

* Use vertical entry screw terminals so ferrules can clear lathe casting.
* More spare GPIO inputs/outputs.
* Another spare encoder channel would be nice too...
* Use JST-style connectors for encoders/button; IDC sockets were a fail.
* GPIO to control button light.
* Isolated RS-485 for spindle motor control and telemetry.
* See if I can cram everything onto one bespoke board.
