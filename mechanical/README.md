# CAD files for mechanical parts

This directory contains CAD files for some of the mechanical parts and
assemblies. They were all designed in FreeCAD 0.21. Some components
require plugins, e.g. the gears workbench and the fasteners workbench.

If you plan on using the CAM jobs included in some of the components,
you will definitiely need to change the machine model and tooling.
